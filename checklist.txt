What we need to interact with:

    mainBoard: This holds all the pieces that have been played
        - Pieces copied up from playerBoard
        - Hintpegs added after call to game engine

    statusBoard: This updates the player on what is happening
        roundCounter: How many rounds played / left

    playerBoard: Where the player makes guesses


    victoryBoard: Displays on a victory

    lossBoard: Displays on a loss
        displaySecert: Shows the secret code


    A game, in Python, is:
        gameID: UUID for the game
            x secretCode: A secret code
            x maxRounds: A max number rounds
            x curRound: Current round
            x gameState: 0, in play - 1, victory - 2, loss
            x playerMoves: A set of all player moves
            x cpuHints: A matched set of all hints
            x gameID: Which game are we referencing?

    When a player submits a guess:
        Javascript:
            x decode div classes into code list
            x POST to /checkMove payload is:
                playerGuess: [0, 1, 1, 1]
                gameID: str
        Python:
            x Send the player's guess list to the game engine
            x Check the guess
            x Record guess and hints
            x increment rounds
            x Check for win/loss
            x return gameData
        Javascript:
            x Create a new row
            x Clear playerBoard
            x If win/lose
                x Hide playerBoard
                x Show victory/lossBoard
            x Else
                x Update roundCounter
